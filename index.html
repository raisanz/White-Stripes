      <h2>RoboFest Regional Competition</h2>
      <p>
        This season, we are competing in the regional RoboFest event in Lutz, FL.
        We are focused on building a robot that can sort packages in a warehouse setting.
        Our robot will acheive this goal by using AI for reasoning, Vex IQ for ease of building, and a bit of DIY to enable our robot to talk to AI.
